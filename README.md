# Thermodynamic and economic assessment of an electrolyser - hydrogen turbine system

## Acknowledgements

This master thesis was carried with the help of the [H-Wind](https://www.marei.ie/project/h-wind) research group supervised by [P. Leahy](https://www.ucc.ie/en/civileng/people/drpaulleahy/) and with the help of prof. [A. Stoppato](https://www.dii.unipd.it/category/ruoli/personale-docente?key=ABF85794D1453051C2A6C35C896F3277) from Padua university.


## Description

To get a good overview of the work all five pieces of code should be downloaded.
From the PEM, SOC models it is possible to assess the performance of the electrolyser, then based on these parameters it is possible to perform the simulation in the files PEM-SOC coupling to get the hydrogen produced.
In the end the cost of the hydrogen/kWh it is obtained with the economic file, which shows the price both by numbers and graphs.
