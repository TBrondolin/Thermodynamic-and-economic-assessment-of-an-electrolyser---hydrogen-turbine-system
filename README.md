To get a good overview of the work all five pieces of code should be downloaded.
From the PEM, SOC models it's possible to assess the performance of the electrolyser, then based on these parameters it's possible to perform the simulation in the files PEM-SOC coupling to get the hydrogen produced.
In the end the cost of the hydrogen and the kWh it is obtained with the economic file, which show them both by numbers and graphs.
